### Hey there üëã

Thank you for stopping by. My name is Saurabh Saxena.

I'm a developer. Have architected and engineered systems in Travel eCommerce, Telecom and BFSI domain.

- **What I'm upto?**
  - I‚Äôm currently on sabbatical break since December 2019.
    - **Why**? Outside the coding passion I'm into rock climbing üßó‚Äç and slacklining \(you would have seen men/women walking on rope in circus, I'm one of them) and hence decided to go rock climbing and slackline.    
  - Meanhwile, since I can't keep myself away from habit of coding and architecting, I've been evolving my skills and try to contribute to open-source community as mush as possible.
